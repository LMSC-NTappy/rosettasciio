.. _msa-format:

EMSA/MSA format
---------------

The ``.msa`` format is an `open standard format
<https://www.microscopy.org/resources/scientific_data/index.cfm>`_
widely used to exchange single spectrum data, but does not support
multidimensional data. It can for example be used to exchange single spectra
with Gatan's Digital Micrograph or other software packages. A wide range of
programs supports exporting to and reading from the ``.msa`` format.

.. WARNING::
    If several spectra are loaded and stacked (``hs.load('pattern', stack_signals=True``)
    the calibration read from the first spectrum and applied to all other spectra.

Extra saving arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the ``.msa`` format the ``format`` argument is used to specify whether the
energy axis should also be saved with the data.  The default, 'Y' omits the
energy axis in the file.  The alternative, 'XY', saves a second column with the
calibrated energy data. It is possible to personalise the separator with the
`separator` keyword.

.. Warning::

    However, if a different separator is chosen the resulting file will not
    comply with the MSA/EMSA standard and RosettaSciIO and other software may not
    be able to read it.

The default encoding is `latin-1`. It is possible to set a different encoding
using the `encoding` argument, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> s.save('file.msa', encoding = 'utf8')
